revealing that your only means of escape is to prove your worth by collecting 6 precious vinyl records:

* Cleo Sol's "Gold Vinyl"
* Faye Webster's "I Know I'm Funny haha Vinyl"
* T.I.'s "Trap Muzik Vinyl"
* The Weeknd's "Thursday Vinyl"
* Kanye West's "Yeezus Vinyl"

These records are hidden throughout the warehouse.  beware, a formidable music historian awaits in 
the final room, and you must gather all the records before facing them to secure your freedom. If not you will be locked in the warehouse forever!

get ready to embark on a thrilling adventure where every trivia question is answered correctly, 
and every vinyl collected brings you one step closer to victory and your ultimate reckoning with the challenges ahead!

 to move throughout the game the movements you must type are: 

*  North
*  South
*  East

Once you leave the Store entrance, it is locked forever! Additionally, you will lose if you meet the music historian without 
all six vinyls. If you answer the trivia questions incorrectly too many times, you will lose. To track how many Vinyls you 
have enter the command STATUS when you are prompted to move. If you want to quit, type the command EXIT when you are prompted to move. Good Luck!""")
